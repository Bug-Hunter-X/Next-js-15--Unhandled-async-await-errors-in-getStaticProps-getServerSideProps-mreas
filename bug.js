In Next.js 15, the use of `async/await` within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.  For example, if an asynchronous operation within these functions throws an error, it might not be properly caught and handled, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error or other issues. This is especially true if the error is a network error or other type of error that is not explicitly handled within a `try...catch` block.
